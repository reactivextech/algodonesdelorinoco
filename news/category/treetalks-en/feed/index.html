]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 is coming to an end. It has been a difficult year for many, yet some nice things have taken place. Corekees has grown again this year, so we planted a lot of new trees. One of the main reasons for this has been the introduction of tree savings with the &#8216;Tree subscription&#8217;. Although there have been a lot of positive reactions to the subscription, it also raises questions with alot of people. This blog will discuss the most asked questions about the Corekees &#8216;Tree subscription&#8217;.</p>
<h2>THE TREE SUBSCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The &#8216;Tree subscription&#8217; is a way to save trees every month at Corekees. Over a period of 20 years, Corekees trees yield an average return of 7.8% per tree per year. These returns can be paid out as returns or reinvested in new trees. Clients can choose this every year: right after the harvest (= the time of payment).</p>
<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT SAVING TREES</h2>
<p>So, now that the subscription has been dealt with, letâ€™s discuss 5 of the most frequently asked questions:</p>
<h4>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TREE SUBSCRIPTIONS AVAILABLE?</h4>
<p>You can choose how many trees you save per month. If you save between 1 and 4 trees per month, one tree will cost â‚¬20,-. If you go for 5 to 9 trees per month it will be â‚¬19,50 per tree. From 10 or more trees per month, trees even cost â‚¬19,- per tree. Because the trees do produce the same, the &#8216;return on investment&#8217; becomes higher the more trees are saved per month. At +5 trees/month the return goes to 8.1% and from 10 trees/month even to 8.5% annual average return (over the 20-year life of the tree).</p>
<h4>WHEN AND HOW DO I GET PAID?</h4>
<p>We expect the first harvest in the 3rd to 4th year after the initial investment (start of subscription). From then on, the return payment will also start. 7 Years after planting the trees they are considered adult (and they will yield full return). The payments take place annually because the trees are harvested once a year. The yield is paid on the account number that is known to us. For the payment you will receive a message from our team.</p>
<h4>HOW LONG DOES THE SUBSCRIPTION LAST?</h4>
<p>The subscription can be cancelled monthly after the first 3 months. All trees that are saved together during the duration of the subscription will remain in your possession for the next 20 years.</p>
<h4>WHAT HAPPENS IF I STOP THE TREE SUBSCRIPTION?</h4>
<p>If you no longer want to save for trees, the monthly depreciation stops. Of course, all trees that are saved at the time of quitting will remain in your possession and will benefit from the yield for another 20 years after the last tree was saved.</p>
<h4>WHERE CAN I FIND THE OVERVIEW OF MY SAVED TREES?</h4>
<p>All data is in the personal account. Here you can find everything you need to know, for example, when the subscription started and the serial numbers of the corresponding bonds.</p>
<p>These were the 5 most frequently asked questions. More questions take a look at the <a href="https://corekees.com/en/help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently asked questions</a>. Are you still missing information or do you want more depth? <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=31683097306&amp;fbclid=IwAR2tikhiD52ayjpIj8ryNboDPkPiGBUsST6eDI-BukA6evN4K0miCZt_xMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatsapp</a> or call us, we&#8217;d love to hear from you!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it is time again to put the spotlight on a Corekees employee. This week the spotlight will be on none other than Claudia Esveldt, our Business Development topper!</p>
<h3>WHO ARE YOU (THINK OF: HOBBIES, WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GREAT OR DO YOU HATE)?</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Claudia, 25 years old and born and raised in Waddinxveen. Actually everyone, except my parents and uncles and aunts, calls me Clau.</p>
<p>Me in 5 words? Tennis crazy, amateur photographer, nature lover, creative and reliable.</p>
<h3>WHAT DO YOU DO AT COREKEES?</h3>
<p>I am involved in the growth of Corekees as a consultant. For example, I look for new sales channels, collaborations and ideas for social media and the website.</p>
<h3>WHAT DO YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT COREKEES?</h3>
<p>Especially 2 things: the team and the concept. I enjoy working with people who are innovative and passionate about their profession.<br />
And that&#8217;s a good thing about this team! In addition, everyone loves dry humour <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Also I am a real fan of the concept; this way of investing is unique because of the win-win situation (return and positive impact) and accessibility.</p>
<h3>WHICH PROJECT/THING YOU HAVE WORKED ON ARE YOU THE MOST PROUD OF?</h3>
<p>Can I say 2 things again? Haha!</p>
<p>The publication in Sprout and The Entrepreneur; these are great platforms for starting companies.</p>
<p>And our current Christmas action! Really a collaboration of the whole team in a relatively short time.</p>
<h3>GOAL FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS?</h3>
<p>In 5 years time I want to have invented something that will create a more climate neutral world.<br />
Besides that I want to have sold 1.000.000 trees with Corekees!</p>
<p>And on a personal level: to have my own home, visited Hawaii and California and improved my tennis skills ;p</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this blog I take a critical look at CO2-compensation and discuss the dangers and benefits, in order to get a clear insight. First I zero in on sustainability, what exactly does it mean and what is the importance of this? Then I will spend some time explaining greenwashing. What is greenwashing and how do companies use it nowadays? Have fun reading!</p>
<p>&#8211; Joost Commissaris &#8211;</p>
<h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
<h4>WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY?</h4>
<p>The definition of sustainability is not entirely unambiguous. The definition that was most comprehensive for me is that of the <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/faq/specifiek/what-is-sustainability-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS</a>: &#8220;sustainable developments are developments that meet the necessities of life of the present generation without compromising those of future generations&#8221;. These are economic, social and environmental needs, including: a clean environment, biodiversity and a highly educated and healthy population.</p>
<h4>THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY?</h4>
<p>What is the importance of sustainability? What aspect of sustainability has the highest priority? As a derivation of the definition in the paragraph above; we must ensure that the generations that follow us can also use the same necessities of life as we do now. This is indeed broad, which is why we limit ourselves to the climate in this blog.</p>
<h4>RULES ON CLIMATE POLICY</h4>
<p>To prevent further climate change, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced. This so-called climate transition can actually only take place if countries work together. That is why the UN started the climate agreement of Paris in 2016. In 2020 there was an agreement between the 28 EU member states with the main goal being to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees of increase. The first agreement is to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030. The ultimate goal is to reduce CO2 emissions by 95% in 2050 compared to 1990.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these targets, a climate plan has been drawn up by each of the member states. These climate plans are valid until 2030, will be updated every 5 years and replaced every 10 years by a new plan.</p>
<h2>GREENWASHING</h2>
<h4>WHAT IS GREENWASHING?</h4>
<p>Greenwashing is a collection of tricks through which companies use something &#8216;good&#8217; for the environment as a marketing trick. So it comes down to companies that pretend to be more sustainable than they really are. Think, for example, of the term &#8216;Natural&#8217;. This term can already be used if 1% of the product consists of natural ingredients. Or the example of &#8216;green electricity&#8217; which is widely advertised, but whose electricity is actually green?</p>
<h4>DIFFERENT WAYS OF GREENWASHING?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of doubts regarding greenwashing, but there are tricks that are often pulled off by companies, below are listed three of the most common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diversion technique: A lot of attention is drawn to a certain aspect of the product as sustainable, while the supply chain of the product is anything but sustainable.</li>
<li>Vagueness: Sustainability is often handled very vaguely. Often terms such as &#8216;planet-friendly&#8217; and &#8216;fair&#8217; are used. As a consumer you can&#8217;t really make any sense of this.</li>
<li>Lack of evidence: If a company claims to be very sustainable, but there is really nothing to be found about in what way and where.</li>
</ul>
<h4>HOW CAN IT BE RECOGNIZED?</h4>
<p>Greenwashing is and remains difficult to recognize, but still there are a number of things you can look for. For example: it is good to be critical about quality marks, there are many marks that really say nothing. On the<a href="https://keurmerkenwijzer.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Milieu Centraal</a> hallmark guide you will find the hallmarks that actually mean something. Also think realistically about the price of products. If a sustainable product is very cheap, it may be that the product is sustainable. However, there is a big chance that the production process of the product does not look sustainable at all. If you don&#8217;t pay the price for the product then someone will pay the price in the supply chain. Furthermore, it is important to rely on your own feelings. If you don&#8217;t trust something, research it. If you are still hesitant after your research, don&#8217;t buy the product!</p>
<h2>CO2-COMPENSATION</h2>
<h4>WHAT IS CO2-COMPENSATION?</h4>
<p>In essence, CO2 compensating is making sure that the CO2 you emit is returned at a different place in the world. This usually happens in two ways:</p>
<p>Let nature absorb CO2. This is a simple concept where, for example, you pay money for the planting/keeping of a forest. The trees then absorb CO2, which in turn reduces the CO2 content in the air.<br />
Another way is to contribute to climate projects. In these climate projects, for example, better wood-fired ovens or windmills are used, where a lot of coal and wood is still used at the moment. This way, a reduction in CO2 emissions and a better living environment is achieved.</p>
<h4>SO THROUGH CO2-COMPENSATION WE CAN CONTINUE?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the reality. If I get on the plane tomorrow and buy trees from the airline to compensate my CO2, emissions will occur immediately and the compensation will only take place many years later. In addition, this way the CO2 level will only be maintained and not reduced.</p>
<h4>OKAY, SO CO2-COMPENSATION DOESN&#8217;T MAKE SENSE?</h4>
<p>This, too, is a bit short. The most important tool for climate change is behavioral change. We need to fly less, travel, eat meat and buy stuff. But we can&#8217;t all do nothing and go nowhere. It&#8217;s certainly not a bad option to compensate for the emissions released in this way.</p>
<h2>THE FUTURE AND COREKEES</h2>
<h4>WHAT SHOULD WE DO IN THE FUTURE?</h4>
<p>Real climate change can only happen if we change our behavior. We have to be more efficient with the available resources. Fly less, eat and consume less meat than we currently do. That is the only way to have a positive long-term impact on the environment.</p>
<h4>OKAY AND THE CO2-COMPENSATION OF COREKEES THEN?</h4>
<p>As told before, it is not realistic we stop buying new stuff and travelling. For these emissions, CO2 offsetting would be a useful tool to become climate-neutral. <a href="https://corekees.com/onze-boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pongamia tree of Corekees</a> absorbs on average more CO2 than a normal tree. A normal tree absorbs an average of 25kg of CO2 per year, the Pongamia tree absorbs an average of 44 kg. Furthermore, we believe that real impact can only be made if consumers are still rewarded for their reduction. At Corekees, this is done by paying back the biofuel yield of the tree to the tree planter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Saving for your child? But using the â€˜Corekees wayâ€™, how does that work?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying, a big trip or a financial contribution for a first home. It doesn&#8217;t matter what, many parents save to give their child financial support from their 18th birthday. What is the best way to do this? And could Corekees play a part in this process? To find out, in this blog post we compare 3 ways of saving for your child: a savings account, investment account and Corekees&#8217; tree-planting subscriptionâ€™.</span></p>
<h2><b>The types of accounts</b></h2>
<h2><b>Savings account</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past people often saved for the future on a so-called silver fleet account. Although some banks still call their account that, the Silver fleet was abolished in 1992 after the expiry of the Youth Savings Act. In this comparison we therefore take the ordinary savings account as our first savings option. The savings interest rate has fallen sharply in recent years; at some banks the interest rate is already almost negative. The interest rate used for this comparison is 0.20%. According to <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/life/artikel/5173020/openbank-spaarrente-02-procent-depositogarantiestelsel#:~:text=Internetbank%20Openbank%20verhoogt%20vandaag%20de,dit%20jaar%20actief%20in%20Nederland." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTL news</a>, this is the highest savings interest rate, which is money for the entire duration of the account.</span></p>
<h2><b>Investing for your child</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â The current savings interest rate of savings accounts is extremely low; about 0.08% according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/sparen-gemiddelde-rente-laag-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. That is why more and more (grand)parents choose to invest for their child.Â  The companies that offer this often have multiple packages, these are based on the risk level of the investment. According to <a href="https://www.robeco.nl/nieuws-en-kansen/wat-is-een-realistisch-rendement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robeco</a>, the return on these investment accounts is around 5%, depending on the spread between shares and bonds. There are often costs associated with both depositing and managing the money, usually around 0.5% of the amount deposited.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Corekees &#8216;boom-savings&#8217; subscription</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Corekees &#8220;tree savings subscription&#8221; build up your savings by buying bonds for the production of <a href="https://corekees.com/onze-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pongamias trees</a>. The tree grows nuts, from which crude oil is pressed. This oil is then sold to oil companies to make biofuel. The entire process up to the sale of the oil emits less CO2 than the tree absorbs during its lifetime, which makes the tree &#8216;CO2 negative&#8217; (that&#8217;s positive&#8230;).Â  Bonds of the tree are valid for 20 years, with an average yield of 7.8% per year. Trees must grow for 3 to 4 years before they start to yield returns, from the 7th year at full strength. Yield is paid annually from the first harvest.</span></p>
<h2><b>Comparison</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compare the three ways of saving for your child, we look at what happens with a deposit of 100 euros per month, for a duration of 5 years. In the table you can see the differences after 5, 10, 18 and 25 years.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8398" src="https://mlvoehnpvwqb.i.optimole.com/ZNTLHgo-JWke9cyR/w:640/h:188/q:75/https://corekees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Frame-13.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="188" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers in these graphs are the total net interest or return for the different years. Because the deposit is returned to the account holder at the end of both the savings account and the investment. This is indicated under the heading &#8216;exit amount&#8217;. Corekees buys bonds (=loan form), because these have been bought, no &#8216;exit amount&#8217; is received at the end of the bond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is particularly noticeable is that the &#8216;investing for your child&#8217; yields the highest return during the first 10 years. Due to the low interest rate, the savings account is not attractive for long-term savings. The tree savings subscription yields the most returns over the entire term, because the trees still grow in the first 7 years. In these years they do not yet yield the full return. Not only is the yield the highest over the entire period, but you also make a positive contribution to the environment. This saves you and for a healthy financial future and planet.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>WHO ARE YOU?</h3>
<p>My friends think it&#8217;s funny that I keep 60 houseplants on 20 m2. I especially find it very cozy, but I am also aware that it is a bit exaggerated. I&#8217;m more often called Nico than Nicole, and I&#8217;ve been a designer at Corekees for 1,5 years now.</p>
<h3>WHY DID YOU START WORKING AT COREKEES?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a designer during the week, and in the weekends as well. I get energy from creating beautiful things, so I like to do that too. The fact that I can combine this at Corekees with contributing to a green and sustainable world suits me perfectly.</p>
<h3>WHAT DO YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT WORKING AT COREKEES? AND WHAT ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF?</h3>
<p>The best things about design at Corekees are quick shifting, tackling opportunities when they arise and the growth and development that we go through over and over again as a result. If you put our identity next to last year&#8217;s, you don&#8217;t recognize us anymore. That&#8217;s making a real impact with my work to me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Some people are convinced that in order to live sustainably it is necessary to live in a tent and live a very simple life. Of course this is one of the most sustainable lifestyles, but it is not realistic for most people in today&#8217;s world. There are a lot of small things you can change to make your current life more sustainable, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of 10 tips for a more sustainable lifestyle.</b></p>
<h3><b>TIP 1: MAKE MORE USE OF LOCAL PRODUCTS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is of course delicious to be able to consume products from all over the world. But there is also a big disadvantage to this, these products are transported from the producer to the consumer. The further the products have to travel, the more impact this has on the environment. So go for a local product in the supermarket, not only do you support local producers, but you also save a lot of exhaust fumes.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 2: THRIFT SHOPPING</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years there has been a growing increase in so-called fast-fashion chains. These will release their new collection at least 2 times a year, but some even more often. Furthermore, these clothes are often cheap for consumers, but this is at the expense of nature. For example, 10% of man&#8217;s total carbon footprint is due to the fashion industry. By buying second hand / vintage clothing, the damage to the environment is not aggravated. Of course, I&#8217;m not telling you to just walk in second-hand clothing, but some garments like flannel shirts, a leather jacket or jeans are very good second-hand.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 3: NOT READY TO EAT ALL VEGETARIAN?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to eat meat-free at least 1 or 2 days a week, this will save you a lot of resources. Research from worldwildlife.org has shown that 1 kilo of flour costs about 750 liters of water and 1 kilo of beef costs about 100,000 liters of water, this is a huge difference.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 4: MAKE YOUR OWN DETERGENT!</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Own detergent? Yes that&#8217;s right, you can make your own detergent in a very easy way. Homemade detergent contains only natural ingredients and is better for your clothes, your skin and the environment. Also, the homemade detergent is much cheaper than the detergent from the supermarket, but just as effective! Curious about a recipe for homemade detergent? Then click</span><a href="https://leukegeit.nl/zelf-wasmiddel-maken/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 5: SEPARATING, DIVIDING AND SEPARATING</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste separation ensures that the waste can be processed correctly. For example, recyclable materials can be reused when making new products. Residual waste is generally incinerated, which results in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO2 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions. So if you separate waste, less waste will be incinerated, so there is less </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO2 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emission and the effect of this in turn has a positive influence on the greenhouse effect.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 6: BUY ONE (OR MORE) PLANT(S) FOR HOME</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common knowledge that plants are good for us, but buying plants for in the house brings many advantages. For example, plants can reduce stress, provide clean air in the house, help against allergies and can even positively influence your sleep. Enough reasons to quickly buy a plant for your home.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 7: PAY ATTENTION TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE THERMOSTAT</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to keep the thermostat between 18-20 degrees in winter. Although it may be tempting to set the thermostat a few degrees warmer. Each degree warmer than 20 degrees will cause 7% more gas consumption and thus 7% more damage to the environment.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 8: AVOID WASTING FOOD</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Netherlands an average of 34 kilograms of food is wasted per person per year. That&#8217;s huge and costs a lot of money. So if you&#8217;re looking for a way to spend less money on groceries, invest time in learning how to combat food waste. Curious about ways you can combat food wastage, take a look at the tips from the</span><a href="https://www.milieucentraal.nl/milieubewust-eten/voorkom-voedselverspilling/#:~:text=Zo'n%209%20procent%20van,Dat%20zijn%20duizenden%20vuilniswagens%20vol"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Milieu Centraal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 9: AVOID THE USE OF DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip 9 to live more sustainably is to avoid disposable products such as: plastic bottles, plastic bags, coffee cups and straws. Instead of these products, choose a product that you can use more than once. For example, a metal straw has the life span of 540 plastic straws and a coffee mug or reusable cup can replace about 500 disposable coffee cups.</span></p>
<h3><b>TIP 10: SWITCH TO A WATER-SAVING SHOWER HEAD</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Netherlands our hot water consumption consists for about 80% of showering. So there can be made considerable savings on the consumption of the current shower head. This is not only positive for nature, but also saves your wallet. If you are curious which of the water saving shower head suits you best, take a look at a comparison</span><a href="https://www.verbouwkosten.com/beste-waterbesparende-douchekop-test/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the 10 Tips for a more sustainable lifestyle. We hope that some of them are applicable to you, because the fight against the climate crisis can only be done together.</span></p>
